    "name":"HIP HOP",
    "about":"The hip hop dance style originated in the Bronx, New York City during the late 1970s. The influence of the music genre, fashion style, and dance took longer to develop compared to the rock music scene in Canada. Although there was a temporary rise in popularity of the genre between 1989 to 1991, it remained an underground phenomenon in Canada until the early 2000s.",
